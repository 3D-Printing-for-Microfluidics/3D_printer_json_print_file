    the build stage and the separation mechanism.Depending on the 3 D printer,
    some of these settings maybe part of a single mechanism which share the same settings(e.g.the build stage and the separation mechanism).It is up to the user to define how partition these settings,
    based on what makes sense
    for their 3 D printer.
    Below is an example of the general
    case .

    Also these settings can be redefined on a per layer basis by defining the setting name in the specfic layer.Because there
    is no way to define what sub category a setting belongs to inside of layer,
    it is important that all settings have unique key names in relation to the 'Default layer settings'
    and any of the sub categories under 'Printer settings'
